# Plus Mobile Apps Blog

*PWA written with the [Polymer](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/apps/templates) starter kit*

To write a developer blog, I had a few goals in mind that I was looking for out of a framework and libraries:

* **Wide reach** - I wanted anybody to be able to access the content from any device whether that be desktop or mobile
* **Offline Usage** - the best user experience in any app is the ability to use it when you have no connection 
* **Fast Development** - I wanted to setup something that looked nice and required minimal effort to start running so I could start writing some of the content

So with these goals in mind, after looking at the various technologies. I landed on making a Progressive Web App using the Polymer app starter kit to get me up and going quickly which could be used as a desktop site or an offline mobile app.
